In 1905, the first Congregational Church, my first religious home in this capital city of Concord, NH, kindly invited me to its one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary; the leading editors and newspapers of my native State congratulate me; their records of my ancestry attest honesty and valor.

                      <p>The Longyear Museum has made several of Mary Baker Eddy's homes available for public tours. Mrs. Eddy lived on on North State Street from 1889-1892 (contact Holly Morris (603)225-3444 for more information about visiting this home). She revised Science and Health for the 50th edition publication and wrote her autobiography Retrospection and Introspection while living here! </p>

                      <p>Mrs. Eddy lived at her "Pleasant view" home from 1892-1908, at which time she reorganized the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, MA. From this home, she guided worldwide activities and gained fame as a religious leader and writer. The building erected on this site in 1927 served as a home for retired Christian Science practitioners and nurses until 1975. On June 30, 1897, Mary Baker Eddy invited "one and all" to visit for the 5th of July. She again invited many to visit her at Pleasant View in 1903 and addressed them from the back balcony facing the hillside and the pond below the house.</p>

                            <p>"Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit they way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass. And He shall bring forth they righteousness as the light, and thy judgement as the noonday."

                            <p>In 1889, when she first moved to Concord... the town boasted a few blocks of cobblestone in the business section as its only street paving.  … the city paving in 1908 consisted of about fifty blocks of well-constructed tarred macadam and concrete pavements.  Mrs. Eddy’s residence in Concord directly contributed to these improvements…</p>
                            <p>The main thoroughfares leading into the city were in such poor condition that in the spring of 1899, a farmer with a light load became stalled in the mire near the entrance to Pleasant View, and at times it was hardly safe for Mrs. Eddy to take her daily drive. … She started the fund for good roads by offering the Concord city government five thousand dollars, which she later increased to eight thousand, for the macadamizing of Pleasant Street.</p>
                            <p>By the summer of 1906, as a result of Mrs. Eddy’s initiative, additional improvements were made…  Mrs. Eddy wrote a letter to the citizens of Concord, published in the papers of June 21, 1906:</p>
                            <p>Our picturesque city greatly needs improved streets.  May I ask in behalf of the public this favor of our city government, namely: –to macadamize a portion of Warren street and …State street throughout?</p>
                            <p>Her appeal to the Concord citizens bore immediate fruit. An article in The Boston Herald of August 8, 1906 reported:</p>
                            <p>Through the suggestion of Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy…the capital city of the Granite state is to have, in the improvement of State street, one of the finest avenues in New Hampshire…</p>

                            <p>Her interest in the welfare of the children of Concord endeared her to many parents.  Learning of the lack of adequate footwear among the school children of the poor, she arranged for each child, whose parents were unable to supply the need, to be provided with a pair of winter shoes. On the day of the State Fair (1902) known as Children’s Day, all the children were admitted free of charge and Mrs. Eddy’s representative presented coupons, redeemable at the store of the merchant, to those children (205) who, after investigation, had been selected to receive them.  … So successful was the plan of distribution, and so great was the need, that she continued her gifts to the children of Concord for several years.</p>

The constituted religious rights in New Hampshire will, I trust, never be marred by the illegitimate claims of envy, jealousy, or persecution.</p>

Freedom to worship God according to the dictates of enlightened conscience, and practical religion in agreement with the demand of our common Christ, the Holy One of Israel, are forever the privileges of the people of my dear old New Hampshire.</p>

                      <p>Another historic moment Mary Baker Eddy and the Christian Science community contributed to in NH was the Treaty of Portsmouth, a peace treaty which ended the war between Russia and Japan. This documentary provides more information about the peace-related efforts of a number of faith communities and spiritual leaders such as the Episcopalians, Congregationalists, as well as those of the Jewish Community, Quakers, Sarah Farmer, founder of the Green Acre Baha'i School in Eliot, Main and Mary Baker Eddy and the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science. The film highlights the role of the Christian Science church and of select Christian Scientists who worked on behalf of this peace treaty.</p>

                    <p>The First Church of Christian Science, Concord, NH was a gift from Mary Baker Eddy to the town Of Concord.</p>

                    <p>Before the church was built, the church community met in Concord at the Christian Science Hall. This was a colonial house remodeled for church services and stood on the corner where the present church edifice stands. The upper floor was converted into an auditorium that seated about two hundred people. Mary Baker Eddy taught her last class and delivered her last sermon in Christian Science Hall in 1898.</p>
                    <p>Following is the summary of the early history of First Church of Christ, Scientist in Concord NH, from <i>The First Church of Christ, Scientist and MIscellany</i>, and as told in the inspired biography, <i>Twelve Years with Mary Baker Eddy, Amplified Edition</i>, by Irving  C.

                            <p>…And now, at this distant day, I have provided for you a modest hall, in which to assemble as a sort of Christian Science kindergarten for teaching the “new tongue” of the gospel with “signs following,” of which St. Mark prophesies.</p>
                            <p>I have purchased a pleasant place for you, and prepared for your use work-rooms and a little hall, which are already dedicated to Christ’s service, since Christian Scientists never stop ceremoniously to dedicate halls. </p>

                            <p>“Mrs. Eddy often spoke of her experience in supervising the remodeling of the colonial mansion in Concord, which she gave to the Concord Scientists as their first church home. After discussing her plan for remodeling the house with one of Concord’s best builders, she engaged him to carry on the work. She wrote of this experience:</p>
                            <p>“He drew the plan, showed it to me, and I accepted it. From that time, October 29, 1897, until the remodelling of the house was finished, I inspected the work every day, suggested the details out­side and inside from the foundations to the tower, and saw them carried out. One day the carpenters’ foreman said to me: “I want to be let off for a few days. I do not feel able to keep about. I am feeling an old ailment my mother had.” I healed him on the spot. He remained at work, and the next morning said to Mr. George H. Moore of Concord, ‘I am as well as I ever was.’”</p>

                            <p>Christian Science Hall will ever occupy a sacred spot in the memory of Christian Scientists who value familiar landmarks in the history of the movement, for it was in this little sanctum that Mrs. Eddy taught her last class in 1898. And it was here, on occasions, that she met members of her Boston church. Over the entrance of the hall, Mrs. Eddy had directed that the following verse be inscribed, which she selected from an old hymn:<br>
                            Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness,<br>
                            Awake! for thy foes shall oppress thee no more!<br>
                            Bright o’er the hills dawns the day‑star of gladness,<br>
                            Arise! for the night of thy sorrow is o’er.</p>

                        <p>This quotation is form an old hymn, believed to be of American origin and was especially loved by Mrs. Eddy.  The hymn was sent for use in the revised Christian Science Hymnal by a member of Mrs. Eddy’s household, the wording being slightly changed to suit the music which was written by E. N. Greenwood.  This framed illuminated first two lines of verse originally hung in the Reading Room in Christian Science Hall at the request of Mrs. Eddy that “it be hung where all who enter may see and read.”  Mrs. Eddy referred to her Church in her message to the Annual Meeting of The Mother Church in 1896 where she writes, “God hath indeed smiled on my church, this daughter of Zion.”</p>

                            <p>That she never lost her great gift of eloquence in after years I am able to testify, for it was my privilege on February 26, 1898, to hear Mrs. Eddy deliver a remark­ably inspiring address in Christian Science Hall, Concord, New Hampshire. At her invitation, a party of First Members of The Mother Church, nearly forty of us in number, were present in the attractive audience room of Christian Science Hall. Every inch of standing room on this historic occasion was taken and many were turned away.</p>
                            <p>After the preliminary exercises were conducted by the First Reader, Mr. Ezra M. Buswell, C. S. D., Mrs. Eddy appeared. As she entered the hall the entire audience by common impulse arose and remained standing until she had taken her place. At that date Mrs. Eddy was in her seventy‑seventh year, yet except for her white hair there was no trace of age in her appearance, manner, gesture, or voice. The Concord Evening Monitor of February 27, 1898, in its account said, “Mrs. Eddy ap­peared at her best, as sprightly and energetic as a young woman.” </p>
                            <p>She took the ninety‑first Psalm as the subject of her address, reading the Scriptures without glasses. Speaking for three quarters of an hour, with neither manuscript nor notes, she appeared as free as though giving an address was to her an everyday occurrence. Her voice was reso­nant, beautifully modulated. She gave to every word its proper value and to every thought the right inflection. Her manner of presentation was so natural, so unaffected, that the attention of her auditors remained wholly on the message and not at all upon the messenger who gave it.</p>
                            <p>The words she chose were as simple and direct as was the manner of her delivery. Although she never hesitated to make use of an apt illustration or a pertinent story to point a moral or to enhance the effectiveness of her mes­sage, there was no flowery rhetoric.</p>
                            <p>It is regrettable that there is no adequate report of this inspiring discourse.</p>

Days of shade and shine may come and go, but we will live on and never drift apart. …</p>

                    <p>The organ has 32 ranks of pipes with 30 stops. The pipes are belgian zinc, polished and lacquered. The Chimes were added and the key action of the organ was converted from tubular pneumatic to electro-pneumatic action in 1937.  The organ was entirely reconditioned in 1952 and has been further refurbished with new leathers. When this rebuilding was completed the organ was given the title “OPUS 70.” The new organ console, installed in 1998, is a Copeman Hart console and was built in England. </p>
 
                    <p>In her letter of gratitude to the members of the New York branch church, Mary Baker Eddy penned the often cited summary of her experience as a Christian Healer and the founder of a world-wide movement:</p>
                    <p>Thus may each member of this church rise above the oft-repeated inquiry, What am I? to the scientific response: I am able to impart truth, health, and happiness, and this is my rock of salvation and my reason for existing.</p>

                      A.I.A. He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris, and later received an LL.D. from Amherst and an honorary M.A. from Williams. His firm of Allen & Collens designed eight buildings at Williams College, twelve at Vassar, Union Theological Seminary’s group in New York, and that of Andover Theological Seminary in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a member of the American Institute of Architects, Boston Society of Colonial Wars, and Society of Mayflower Descendants. –from The Society of Architectural Historians</p>
                      <p>The contractor was E. Noyes Whitcomb of Boston, the father of Miss Ethel Whitcomb, former Second Reader of The Mother Church and later a member of the Board of Lectureship.  E. Noyes Whitcomb was the contractor for the original Mother Church in 1894.  He was also the contractor for the State House in Boston and the Gale Memorial Library in Laconia, among many other libraries and buildings in New England.</p>

Tomlinson accompanied Mrs. Eddy during this visit and is said to be responsible for these details described.]</p>
                            <p>Mr. Editor: <br>
                            “Yesterday, for the first time, the Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy visited the new Christian Science church in this city, her munificent gift to the local congregation of that faith.</p>
                            <p>“Mrs. Eddy entered the church by the southeast door [correction: southwest*], which admitted her to the room prepared for her use in the edifice, which the Scientists call “Our Leader’s room,” and those who planned this pretty apartment should know the pleasure it gave her.  Her artistic sense took in at a glance the beautiful circles of light falling in pendants like grape clusters [reference to the ‘electolier’ floor lamp], the delicate pale green upholstery, embroidered silk drapery, the highly polished Indiana oak floor, and the lighting, done by means of numerous incandescent bulbs deftly hidden in the corniced moulding of the room; also the beautiful bound copies of the Bible and her own published works, and other dainty, costly gifts from members of her church.  </p>
                            <p>“After spending some time here, Mrs. Eddy visited the public Reading Room, which is kept open every week-day from 2 to 5 P.M.  Thence she entered the church proper, and after a general survey took a seat in one of the carved upholstered pews, to view deliberately the magnificent transept windows, the grand gift of First Church of Christ, Scientist, of New York City, placed in position last week.  Mrs. Eddy regards these windows as exceptional specimens of the highest art; they were described in your columns last Saturday. [Christian Science Journal, Vol. 23, p. 435-6; see the Windows section of this website]  The organ engaged her attention, and called forth encomiums [a formal expression of high praise]; the graceful lines of the massive roof-timbers, the fine natural finish of the Indiana oak comprising the entire woodwork, the interlocking noiseless rubber floor tiling, the harmony of coloring and arrangement of the entire auditorium, were all noted and favorably commented upon with much joy.”      </p>

                          <p>These seven quotations on the walls were all chosen by Mary Baker Eddy, and this is the only church with these particular quotations.  This is authenticated in a letter from George H. Kinter, Mrs. Eddy’s secretary, to Irving C Tomlinson on June 30, 1904 (the original is archived in The Mary Baker Eddy Library).  At Mrs. Eddy’s request, her name was omitted from the three quotations from Science and Health.  The quotations are worded differently from the present edition and were taken from the 1904 edition of Science and Health, in use at the time.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>But thou, when thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. -Jesus (Matt 6:6)</li>
                            <li>No wisdom is wise but his wisdom: no truth is true, no love is lovely, no life is life but the divine: no good is, but the good God bestows. -Science and Health</li>
                            <li>The spiritual sense of Truth must be gained before Truth is understood, this sense is assimilated only as we are honest, unselfish, living, and meek. -Science and Health</li>
                            <li>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard. -Psalms</li>
                            <li>Church is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body. - Ephesians</li>

                            <h3>Windows</h3>
                            <p>Mary Baker Eddy visited the church only once after its completion and that visit was for the purpose to see these new windows from England after they had been installed.  She is said to have stayed for a whole hour looking at these windows..</p>
                            <p>Authorization and fine details of her visit and reactions as conveyed to the reporter by Irving C. Tomlinson, who accompanied her on this one church visit, comes from an article in The Concord (N. H.) Daily Patriot and is quoted in the 1904 Christian Science Sentinel, Vol. 8:54, and in the 1905 Christian Science Journal, Vol. 23, p. 435-6.  The description, in its entirety, can be read in the Edifice section of this website. </p>
                            <p>Besides the fine transept windows, the church is filled with beautiful stained glass windows.  The side windows, of which there are four on each side, including those on the steps leading up to the balcony, are large and full of color.  The Rose Window at the front of the church, above the front door and at the rear of the balcony, includes the cross and crown.</p>
