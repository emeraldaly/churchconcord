                <p>The current renovations are part of a five-year comprehensive program to preserve the historic edifice Mary Baker Eddy to the members of the Concord Church.</p>
                <p>Over a year prior to ‘letting the need be known’ in 2014 when the Five-Year Preservation Plan was initiated, a Preservation Committee and all of the church members prayed for God’s guidance in laying the spiritual foundation.  An internal Case Statement was written with many edits and then refined by one of our church members.</p>
                <p>The Links below provide detailed information about this Preservation Plan, and also includes information about restoration projects completed through the years.</p>
                <p>Within each section you will find links to other sections on related topics.  We hope you will enjoy learning more about our preservation work and seeing photographs of this landmark church.</p>
                <p>These linked Preservation pages are organized in the following manner for your information, and are included with links, below:</p>

                            <h3>Founding Vision</h3>
                            <img src="images/Tower-ext.jpg" alt="tower">
                            <p>First Church of Christ, Scientist, of Concord, NH, is committed to worshiping the Father, “in spirit and in truth” (John 4:23-24). Our endeavor is to glorify God by demonstrating divine Science, the Comforter promised by Christ Jesus, and found in the inspired Word of the Holy Bible and the revelation of Mary Baker Eddy, the Discoverer, Founder and Leader of Christian Science.</p>
                            <p>Thus, we see Church preserved through watching, working and praying in fellowship with Christ, the Tenets of Christian Science, the definition of Church in the Glossary of Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (see page 583) and Mrs. Eddy’s other spiritual models, rules and prayers for Church1 –The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, MA, and our branch church. Our healing and saving mission, individually and collectively, is demonstrated in our spiritually active church membership.</p>
                            <p>Through her founding vision of the Church of Christ, Scientist, and her magnanimous philanthropic giving in support of its mission, Mary Baker Eddy gave to her followers, the Concord community, and the world, a vital example, and a major financial gift toward building our landmark church edifice, dedicated in 1904. Her demonstrated spiritual model of philanthropy inspired Christian Scientists then to contribute substantially to this demonstration of Church. Today, proper stewardship of her gift calls for our wholehearted, grateful response and engagement in her prayerful vision:</p>
                            <p>“God grant that this church is rapidly nearing the maximum of might, – the means that build to the heavens, that it has indeed found and felt the infinite source where is all, and from which it can help its neighbor.” (Please see Mrs. Eddy’s acknowledgement letter in The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, p. 165.)</p>
                            <p>1 Mary Baker Eddy’s writings: Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, p. 583:12-19, 35:19-25, Manual of The Mother Church, especially the Tenets and Historical Sketch, pp. 15 -19, and her messages and letters in Prose Works to The Mother Church and its branches.</p>
                            <h3>Our Mission "Living Stones We Each in His Place"</h3>
                            <img src="images/Platformrafters.jpg" alt="Platform and Rafters">
                            <p>Our mission answers Mrs. Eddy’s prayer for the Christian Science Church in Concord, NH: “0 may your temple and all who worship therein stand through all time for God and humanity!” (My 158: 27-30; Hymn 176:3 ; I Peter 2:4-6)</p>
                            <p>To accomplish this, we commit ourselves to more fully realizing the spiritual essence and healing activity of Mrs. Eddy’s Church, her gift and our stewardship of it. Working scientifically to discern the ever-present concrete reality of Truth and Love, we see it proved in our healing practice and service to God and humanity.</p>
                            <p>Then efforts to preserve and use our landmark edifice in service of our mission become steps of true progress for this branch, its members and the community it serves. As we see and take each footstep of Truth, we are being equipped to properly maintain and progressively preserve our church, including its edifice.</p>
                            <p>“Every step of progress is a step more spiritual.
                            The great element of reform is not born of human wisdom; it draws not its life from human organizations; rather is it the crumbling away of material elements from reason, the translation of law back to its original language, – Mind, and the final unity between man and God.” (People’s Idea of God, Mary Baker Eddy, p. 1.)</p>
                            <p>This law of unity ” … reveal[s] man collectively, as individually, to be the son of God.” (Miscellaneous Writings, Mary Baker Eddy, 164:28) It presents the scientific demand that democracy be expressed in our spiritual understanding and demonstration of God’s government and our Church. In this unity of Love, all our branch church members are participating in this church preservation project.  We honor their contributions in proof of the universal law of Love sustaining and animating our collective mission.</p>
                            <p>As spiritual qualities and vision essential to our worship of Spirit are exercised – not beliefs in matter or materialism – they not only invigorate our healing work, they provide supplies for restoration of the appearance and structure of our historic edifice.  We rejoice as First Church of Christ, Scientist, Concord, NH, and its edifice correspond more closely to the realization and demonstration of spiritual reality: Soul’s beauty of holiness, Principle’s supporting integrity, Spirit’s enduring substantiality, eternal Life’s vitality, divine Mind’s intelligent design, immortal Truth’s structure, and universal Love’s perfect care-all uplifting thought to God and His spiritual idea, Spirit’s All-power and All-presence.</p>

                            <h3>Laying the Foundation for Restoration and Preservation Projects</h3>
                            <p>Over the years, there has not been a year when some restoration work has been done.  Since the 1960s monies have been budgeted for needed repairs and, since the 1990s, around $50,000 annually has been budgeted and spent for important restoration projects.</p>
                            <p>In 2010 an historical architect, Max Ferro, was engaged to evaluate structural needs, and upon his recommendation we also hired a structural engineer, mechanical engineer, and an electrical engineer to inspect our buildings, evaluate, and prepare reports in their respective disciplines. </p>
                            <p>Max’s report discusses the need for a renovation and maintenance program that will ensure the perpetual care of the building. The program recommended in his report includes four essential elements: first; the everyday maintenance, second; emergency repairs, third; planned maintenance, and fourth; is the cyclical maintenance. Each one of these elements is equally important.  He has made it clear to us that we need to have a program in place for cyclical maintenance in order to stay ahead of problems that would occur without such a program. We also shouldn’t expect to renovate the building and then expect it to be maintenance free for a number of years to come; we will still need to follow a continuous maintenance program.</p>
                            <P>Prior to these reports, many projects have been completed.  Between 1960 and 1999, over $400,000 was expended for maintaining the church building, and since 2000, nearly $500,000 has been put into restoration and preservation projects.  These figures do not include monies spent on the Sunday School and much on the organ.  For more details on completed projects, see Completed Projects 1960 – 1990s, Completed Projects 2000 – Present, and Future Projects Planned pages. </P>

                            <h3>Historical Architect, our Adviser</h3>
                            <p>We have been blessed since the day one of our members met Max Ferro and he agreed to be our historical architect adviser.  He has long had respect for the architects who designed the Concord Christian Science church and loves being involved with its preservation.</p>
                            <p>As for the present and the future, we are including a combined summary of Max Ferro’s report and three engineers’ report, edited along with a House and Grounds Report to the Board of Trustees.</p>
                            <p>In 2011 it was approved by our Board of Trustees to request that historical architect, Max Ferro, update and expand his original report he had prepared for our church in 2006. Upon his recommendation we also hired a structural engineer, mechanical engineer, and an electrical engineer to inspect our buildings, evaluate, and prepare reports in their respective disciplines.</p>
                            <p>Max has considerable experience with historic buildings.</p>
                            <p>Maximilian L. Ferro, Biography</p>
                            <p>Max, now our good friend, is a practicing architect, historical architect and architectural historian based in Weare, New Hampshire. </p>
                            <p>He heads The Preservation Partnership, set up in 1977 as New England’s first architectural office to provide multi-disciplinary services in the Historic Preservation field. The firm, now past its 28th Anniversary, has more than thirty Town and City Halls, more than thirty Public Libraries, and scores of police and fire stations, community centers, museums, educational facilities and other municipal projects to its credit.</p>
                            <p>Max established the building conservation components of the graduate Historic Preservation programs at Boston University and the University of Vermont, and held the adjunct rank of Assistant Professor at each university for about 15 years. He has been a frequent visiting lecturer at Harvard, Yale, MIT, and universities throughout the US and Canada.</p>
                            <h3>Preservation Structural Report</h3>
                            <p>Max Ferro, an historical architect, advised us to acquire the services of experienced engineers, one of these being Arthur Macleod, a structural engineer.  He and Max have considerable experience with historic buildings and each have impressive resumes (see the biography of Max Ferro on the Historical Architect page ***future link).  Max coordinated with the engineers, reviewed their reports, and also supplemented the reports with further comment regarding specific issues.</p>
                            <p>The review by Arthur MacLeod, structural engineer, included a lengthy building inspection and a review of structural plans which needed to be photographed in their archived location in Boston. The report makes detailed observations of the building envelope, which includes the roof, masonry, and windows, and of the structure which includes the framing structural members of the building. There are too many observations and recommendations to briefly summarize, but there are some key points that should be highlighted.</p>
                            <img src="images/tower-drawing-med.jpg" alt="Tower 1">
                            <img src="images/tower-drawing-2.jpg" alt="Tower 2">
                            <h3>Tower Needs</h3>
                            <img src="images/tower-top.jpg" alt="Tower top">
                            <p>The report addresses concerns regarding the tower. Additional structural ties are recommended to be added to support the fleche (the highest portion including the roof). A design recommendation is included in the report. There is also the recommendation to add ventilation to the tower in order to reduce condensation from forming on the inside walls, which causes moisture problems.</p>
                            <p>There are open joints in the tower granite, especially in the corners, and the inside brick lining of the tower is wet, doubtlessly due to both condensation and flashing leaks.</p>
                            <img src="images/tower-interior.jpg" alt="Interior of tower">
                            <p>We need to go from reacting to emergencies to doing some advanced planning with suitable engineers, as we are now proposing.  Max recommends studies be done by a mechanical engineer and also an electrical engineer’s study is needed.</p>
                            <p>The central steeple (more correctly termed a fleche) which has massive weight, rests on the brick of the outer tower walls. Mr. Macleod has recommended for the tower: Steel Reinforcement. Provide tie rods at the transfer beam level to resist thrust forces at the window arches. In his report he specifies further details as to exactly what is needed.</p>
                            <h3>Buttress Issues</h3>
                            <p>Max Ferro, our historical architect, has been looking at historic buildings for nearly forty years, and he is concerned about the buttresses, which help to resist the thrust of the roof. Buttresses are a notorious problem in almost every Gothic church. Yours, unfortunately, have somewhat greater problems than the usual wind and weather exposure on three sides.</p>
                            <img src="images/buttress-1-sm.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <img src="images/buttress-2-sm.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <img src="images/buttress-3-patches.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <p>The roof or cap of each buttress, itself a coping stone, needs the same through-wall flashing underneath, which it does not have. With the long wall behind each buttress expanding and contracting much more than the buttresses themselves, such joints fail it is obvious by observation that the buttresses are full of water and are breaking apart from the main wall. Even stalactites and stalagmites have formed as in wet caves, and forming such deposits takes constant dripping over many years.</p>
                            <img src="images/Corner-buttress.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <img src="images/W-buttress+tower.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <img src="images/Corner-buttresses.jpg" alt="Buttress">
                            <p>While it would be good to find a simpler answer, Max suspects we will need to take down at least one buttress and rebuild it in order to assess the exact scope of the present damage.</p>
                            <h3>Water Issues</h3>
                            <p>Typically the water that leaks into the structure then evaporates in the cavity space where furring supports the plaster. However, excessive water leads to interior problems as we see in our church. The report summarizes other possible sources of excessive leaking including the coping, flashing, and the window trim. There is no one single source to blame for the leaks, but a combination of various sources. The report makes detailed recommendations to waterproof the building.</p>

                            <h3>Coping/Capstone Issues</h3>
                            <p>Coping is the capstone that keeps water out of the top of a masonry wall. All masonry walls, both brick and stone, have two or more layers, called withes. In this church the inside is brick, which is the main support of the walls, and is covered with granite on the exterior. The method of coping used was, instead of the preferred method using copper with bronze dowels (used by the ancient Greeks, which remains waterproof practically forever), the budget alternative using sticky sheets of tar paper was used, waterproof when installed, but, unknown to those in the early 20th century, that it would break down chemically in less than 30 years. The church walls have been filling with water ever since the early 1930s. Photos show the pattern of cracked and open joints through which water has flowed. Repair records that go back to 1946 include endless repointing, but if the water is entering the wall at the top, between the coping stones, all that repointing did is keep the water hidden inside the wall until the damage was extensive. All coping stones need to be temporarily lifted and then replaced over through-wall metal flashing.</p>
                            <h3>Voussoirs and Other Water Issues</h3>
                            <p>Voussoirs are the wedge-shaped stones that form an arch and the central voussoir is called a keystone. </p>
                            <img src="images/capstone.jpg" alt="Capstone">
                            <p>Here, for example, is the voussoir above the door to the Mary Baker Eddy room.</p>
                            <p>The issue is the connection with the wall that needs pointing of the vertical joints and to press down into each fresh joint a soft lead “T”-cap, hammered flat to protect the joint. A certain vulnerability still remains due to a lack of flashing.</p>
                            <p>Once water is inside a building, it becomes exponentially more difficult to deal with. One must find the source of the leak outside. But the source may be very far away, with water flowing inside hollow walls and ceilings to emerge in unexpected places.</p>

                            <h3>Clerestory Roof Issues</h3>
                            <img src="images/Clerestory-N.jpg" alt="N Clerestory">
                            <img src="images/Clerestory-S.jpg" alt="S Clerestory">
                            <p>The clerestory roofs are at both the North and South side of the church.  Looking back over years of repairs, it is obvious there is a major problem with these two clerestory roofs.  They have been repaired often and the source of the problem is the ice that plummets down from the roof above piercing the slate roof below.  The ceilings have missing plaster pieces not yet repaired due to the need for a permanent solution to this recurring problem.  Holes in the roof have been patched and damaged slates have been replaced.</p> 
                            <p>The winter of 2013-2014 was especially problematic with one Wednesday evening meeting being disrupted with water leaking in from a damaged area in the clerestory roof from falling ice.  Large plastic sheets were hung to catch the water and prevent damage to the cushions or wooden pews.  Needless to say the meeting was a little on the loud side with the plastic sheets amplifying the sound.  Actually, though, we found the experience to have its rewards.  Before the meeting a small band of faithful members came swiftly to help with buckets and plastic sheets and one member sat nearby to keep an eye on the buckets lest they overflow.</p>
                            <p>Max Ferro and the structural engineer have recommended wooden roof reinforcement, covered with copper, and then shingled with strong and flexible fiberglass shingles.  This would create a relatively permanent solution to this recurring problem.  This, solution, however is quite expensive, but is one of our priorities.</p>
                            <h3>Repair Principals</h3>
                            <p>Systems and components must meet safety codes and durability standards and should conform to an aesthetic consistent with good preservation practice. In general, the work should meet the guidelines for preserving this building under The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and as accepted by the Church.</p>
                            <h3>Preservation – Other Engineers’ Reports</h3>
                            <p>Besides the Structural Report, two other engineers’ reports have been done: the Mechanical Report and the Electrical Report</p>
                            <h3>Mechanical Report</h3>
                            <p>The Mechanical Report was prepared by Kaz Safari of Environmental Design Engineering.  Basically the report is divided into three separate parts; the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), the plumbing, and fire protection.</p>
                            <h4>Ventilation</h4>
                            <p>The report recommends that outside air replenishment be increased to improve circulation.  The report also suggests ceiling mounted paddle fans to evenly distribute heat and improve efficiency. The report also recommends adding control valves to the existing steam radiators.</p>
                            <h4>Plumbing</h4>
                            <p>The sanitary piping is over 100 years old for the church and 50 years old for the Sunday school, are beyond their life expectancy, and should be further inspected and repaired or replaced as warranted. As we have experienced problems in the past, repair is likely needed.</p>
                            <h3>Electrical Report</h3>
                            <p>The report on the electrical system was prepared by Electrical Engineer Charles Ackroyd. Like the other reports this one, too, makes numerous observations of the current system and recommendations for improvements.</p>
                            <p>While currently functional, there are improvements that are needed to update the system. Of particular importance are safety improvements that are needed at the main circuit panel. The circuit panel board in the stairwell to the podium is also out of date and out of code and needs replacement.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the report notes that there is no lightning protection system despite the fact that the tower is over 150 feet tall. A lightning protection system is also a building code requirement.  It is recommended that a system be designed and installed and that it include a surge suppressor in accordance with the current code.</p>
                            <h3>Other building elements and features</h3>
                            <p>We are blessed with quite an incredible building, constructed under the guidance of our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, that has served our congregation and has been a landmark in our community for over 100 years. The church architecture is appreciated by Max Ferro, an historical architect, who has had extensive experience with historical structures of this type, and by each of the engineers, by many subcontractors involved in the maintenance and repair of the building, and by the Concord community.</p>
                            <p>Proper care of the church will require a continuous maintenance program in order to maintain the integrity of the building. This should not be a burden to our congregation, but an opportunity to care for the church we all love.</p>

                        <h3>Required Heating Changes 2017</h3>
                        <p>The church has been heating with steam from a pipe coming in from the street and in the fall of 2016 we were informed that Concord Steam closed in May, 2017.  All Concord downtown buildings, including the public schools, have needed to plan for alternative heating sources.  The Concord Steam heating system is old, inefficient, and quite costly.  The new system will save us almost 50%/year in heating costs going forward, with an expected payback of about 10 years.</p>
                        <img src="images/windowside-arches-sm.jpg" alt="Arches">
                        <p>We researched, received estimates, and had a special church meeting where the membership voted on the proposals of the House and Grounds Committee.  We voted to contract for two natural gas boilers and for the preparation ground-work needed before they are installed, including a chimney liner, as well as what was needed after they were installed. </p>
                        <p>The boiler room has been built in the church basement and the two boilers are now set in place.  The piping system for the incoming natural gas is complete.  The new boilers are now keeping us warm after repeated bleeding of the pipes that were filled with sediment from the years of quite unclean steam coming from the street pipes.  Fire detectors are in now in place.</p>
                        <h3>Chimney Liner Installed 2017</h3>
                        <p>Before the new boilers were fired up, the chimney needed to be lined. The project went as planned and the chimney liner was set in place.</p>

                        <p>In order to complete this project, each organ pipe was taken down, moved to the back of the church and wrapped for protection.  The speakers also were taken down for protection. This took approximately one week.  As of April 16th most of the organ pipes have been placed back up.  And we have discovered from Andover Organ Company who did this pipe removal and re-installation that there are 2,319 playing pipes, plus others just for show. </p>
