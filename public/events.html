                        <p>Interested in learning how to pray effectively? Then this is the talk for you! Nate Frederick will be sharing some of his best experiences, insights, and tips on how to heal mind and body. His live lecture “Learn to pray and heal” explores faith that isn’t blind, how to understand God as Love itself and how to express Love unselfishly.</p>
                        <p>Nate’s talk is inspired by the Bible-based healing principles discovered by Mary Baker Eddy and set down in her breakthrough book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Everyone is welcome to attend this free one-hour talk on Tuesday, June 21, at 7:00 PM at the Red River Theatres, 11 South Main Street, Concord, NH.</p>
                        <p>Nate studied perennial religion at Hampshire College where he was introduced to Christian Science healing. After traveling the world for a year and hiking extensively in the Himalayas, Nate came to Boston in 2008 to work for his church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist.  Since then, he has served in many capacities, including launching and producing the award-winning Daily Lift podcast and Time4Thinkers’ Weekly Musician. Nate has shared the Good News at jails, rehab centers and interfaith-events. He’s also been widely involved in composing, producing and performing Christian music.</p>
                        <p>Nate’s many hobbies include adventuring in the outdoors and writing songs, but he says, “Without comparison, my greatest love, my greatest joy— my mission — is to transform lives and heal the sick through Christianly Scientific prayer.” Nate has seen everything from broken hearts to broken bones and cancer healed through prayer alone.</p>

                        <p>How did a 19th century woman arrive at concepts that are still ahead of their time a century later?</p>
                        <p>Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) was a pathfinding thinker who wrote about the “Science of Christianity” and its practical effects on health. </p>
                        <p>Christian Science has deep roots in Concord. It’s founder, Mary Baker Eddy, grew up in nearby Bow, NH, and had her residence and the headquarters of her movement in Concord for 19 years. For over 100 years there have been talks on Christian Science in the area given every year by practitioners of Christian Science who speak about Christian Science and its system of healing.</p>
                        <p>Chet Manchester lectures on Mrs. Eddy worldwide. He is a practitioner, teacher of Christian Science, and a member of the Christian Science Board of Lectureship.</p>
                        <p>On christianscience.com Chet says of his experiences:</p>
                        <p>“I love Christian Science, creativity, and youthful thinking.  For the last twenty years, I’ve had the grand adventure of putting all these to work in numerous roles at The Mother Church and The Mary Baker Eddy Library.  After college, I lived in places like Kenya, France, and Los Angeles.  While working professionally as creative director and video producer, my greatest love was always healing.  This came into sharp focus for me after a failed film venture in the 1990s that resulted in a serious health problem.  One morning, I opened to Mary Baker Eddy’s words in The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany, “The heart that beats mostly for self is seldom alight with love.”  I realized that the SOLE function of the heart is to beat for God, to give God our all.  There’s nothing more demanding (in a good way) and freeing than giving one’s heart to God, devoting oneself to spiritual healing.  This shift in motive and thought brought profound healing and progress to my life. I’ve never looked back.  I’ll be honest, it took me years to commit myself fully to the public practice of Christian Science healing.  But it’s been an absolute joy to give myself to this ministry since 2009, as well as to serve on the Christian Science Board of Lectureship since 2007.  Mary Baker Eddy’s vision for Christian Science was and is breathtaking, and there’s no question that her life and ideas are ripe for rediscovery in the 21st century.”</p>
                        <p>During his freshmen year at Dartmouth College, Chet Manchester took a class in alternative education that inspired him to drop out of college and map out his own approach to education. Pursuing his love for art, illustration, and filmmaking, Chet earned a degree in studio art from Principia College in 1982. Since then, he has lived and worked in Kenya, France, and on both US coasts. His artistic and storytelling skills brought him to Seneca Falls, New York, in 1998 where he helped to design an exhibit about Mary Baker Eddy for the Women’s Rights National Historic Park. He later served as creative director for the exhibits and programs that opened in Boston at the Mary Baker Eddy Library in 2002. Chet also wrote a screenplay about Eddy and contributed to the research for a feature film about Mark Twain’s fascination with her. Since then, he has devoted his energies to an active ministry of spiritual healing as a Christian Science practitioner, teacher, and lecturer. In 2012, he served as President of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, which publishes the Pulitzer prize-winning newspaper, The Christian Science Monitor. Today, Chet helps to manage the international speakers bureau for the Christian Science church from his home base in King Ferry, New York where he lives with his wife and two children. Chet’s blogs and talks can be found regularly on christianscience.com.</p>

                        <p>Christian Science has deep roots in Concord. It’s founder, Mary Baker Eddy, grew up in nearby Bow, NH, and had her residence and the headquarters of her movement in Concord for 19 years. For over 100 years there have been talks on Christian Science in the area given every year by practitioners of Christian Science who speak about Christian Science and its system of healing. This year alone, free public talks have been given in Milford, Nashua, Derry, Manchester, Portsmouth, Dover, Hanover, New London and Laconia.  Concord’s talk will be presented on December 2nd, and the final talk for this calendar year will be presented in Plymouth on December 7th.</p>
                        <p>Concord’s talk is entitled: “The Real You—No Limitations.” Our lecturer, Tom McElroy, lives in the Boston area and has lectured all over the United States and in many countries abroad. After graduating from college Tom ran a branch of finance bank, and at the same time, volunteered as a prison Chaplain in Los Angeles, where he worked with inmates in men’s, women’s, and youth facilities.  Tom comments: “I’ve always loved meeting new people and learning fresh and inspiring ideas. Through my study of Christian Science, I’ve found that a better understanding of God helps me connect with all kinds of people and to appreciate and enjoy the many diverse expressions of divine Life and Love which fill the globe. It will be a real treat to be in Concord for this talk.”   Come and give Tom an opportunity to nourish your spirit!</p>

                        <p>Defeating Violence: An Invitation to the Community to Pray by John Q. Adams</p>
                        <p>Concord, NH PATCH Post by Chris Coombs, June 27, 2013</p>
                        <p>Concord, NH:  Following the Newtown, Connecticut massacre and the Boston bombing, cities and individuals all over, have been grappling for solutions to end the cycle of violence facing our communities.  On Monday, June 17th, First Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science Church), with over a 100 year history in Concord, offered a public talk as a gift to the community at Concord High School, to take a fresh look at prayer as a key solution to combat violence. Local business executive Chris Coombs, a member of the Church’s Board noted, “We wanted to engage with our community to look for a more meaningful solution to stop violence.  As part of the faith community, we feel that appealing to the heart of each and every individual helps the process of healing the culture of violence in a very real way.”</p>
                        <p>The Christian Science Church invited Mr. John Quincy Adams III, CSB, an international speaker based in New York City to come to Concord to give a talk titled Defeating Violence with Prayer.  Mr. Adams is in the healing ministry of Christian Science and is an authorized teacher and lecturer who has spoken everywhere, in prison facilities, educational institutions, churches, medical facilities, and drug treatment centers. Adams, who has been a healer for over 25 years, was himself healed of a serious drug habit using the system of healing as taught in Christian Science.</p>
                        <p>Mary Baker Eddy, a resident of Concord during the 19th century, was an author, religious pioneer and spiritual healer who discovered Christian Science in 1866.  Her primary work, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, is a book with universal ideas about practical spirituality.  Mrs. Eddy also founded a college for teaching Christian Science healing, an international church, and multiple publications, including the world-renowned, award-winning newspaper, The Christian Science Monitor.</p>

                        <p>A New View of Man/Woman</p>
                        <p>Those who attended the talk were given a fresh look at the practicality of man’s identity as created in the image of God, as stated in the Holy Bible (Genesis 1:26-27).  “Each of us is an individual expression of God and we are each connected.  Understanding this deeply, we can know that each one is our brother or sister and so we would not want to hurt our family,” noted Adams. During the talk, Adams shared accounts of individuals who overcame violent impulses through prayer that awakened them to their true spiritual nature as a child of God.  And with that awakening, and through it a humble acknowledgement of wrong, both individuals had major character transformations that resulted in physical healings as well. Through prayer alone, one was healed of a severely injured hand that occurred during a fistfight.  Another individual was completely liberated from a life of gang violence and was also healed of fractured facial bones from a motorcycle accident and a medically diagnosed case of diabetes.</p>
                        <p>As evidenced by these illustrations of healing, the power of prayer transforms individual lives, which in turn, will result in a positive impact on the community. “Evil cannot be defeated with evil, but can only be overcome and destroyed through our prayers and good efforts,” Mr. Adams shared.</p>
                        <p>Among those who attended was a pastor from a different denomination who expressed his appreciation for the talk. To paraphrase: “I have been aware of Christian Science and its emphasis on healing for some time, but this is the first time I have acted to learn more. I am so glad I did!”  Another attendee commented, “Wow, that’s a lot to think about! It’s really radically different to think of man as the perfect offspring of a perfect, right-now-present God! And it is really something to think that we can, by praying every day along these lines, make a difference in our own lives, and by that, touch the lives of so many others with our healing thought!”</p>
                        <p>Jennifer Doak, an attorney and a Christian Scientist, noted, “I am grateful that we were able to share and extend our love to our community through this talk.  We each came away with new insight and refreshed resolve to pray for an end to violence.”</p>
                        <p>Silent Prayer for the Community</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the talk, the entire audience was urged to observe a time of silence to pray for the community and the world.  The time of silence was a powerful “exclamation point” to know and understand that each person’s individual prayer can help end the cycle of violence and bring about a culture of peace.  Coombs commented:  “Much good will come from this. Our community will continue to be blessed by this event.”</p>
                        <p>Around the world, societies and individuals are grappling with the problem of violence, searching for an alternative. International speaker, practitioner and teacher of Christian Science healing, John Q. Adams says, “I’ve seen in my own experience how prayer brings solutions to the problem of violence.” For over 25 years John has shared the healing power of prayer to transform individual lives spiritually through Christian Science healing.</p>
                        <p>Adams, a practitioner and teacher of Christian Science healing, will present a talk titled, “Defeating Violence with Prayer.”  He will reference the original sourcebooks on Christian healing, the Bible, along with Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy, a book of universally applicable ideas on practical spirituality.   Christian Science, a religion and system of healing, was discovered and founded by Mary Baker Eddy, a prominent resident of Concord for 19 years.  This community healing event is an opportunity for folks to explore together the healing power of prayer to defeat violence.</p>
                        <p>Both here in New Hampshire and all across the country, folks are reeling from the bombardment of news stories of unthinkable violence.  For sure, we all need a healing answer to this aggressive and domineering issue. Whether it’s cyber-bullying, date rape, domestic or child abuse, or acts of terror, everyone has been impacted by violence and most are seeking a peaceful solution.</p>
                        </p>“During this talk, I will share accounts of individuals who overcame violent impulses through prayer that awakened them to their true spiritual nature as a child of God,” says Adams.  “Through an acknowledgement of wrong, both individuals had major character transformations that resulted in physical healings as well: one of a severely injured hand that occurred during a fist fight, and the other of fractured facial bones from a motorcycle accident, and a medically diagnosed case of diabetes.  The major thrust of this lecture is to emphasize that evil cannot be defeated with evil, but that it can be overcome and destroyed through our prayers and good efforts.”</p>
                        <p>Originally from Ohio, Adams moved to New York City to pursue an acting career, studying with Lee Strasberg and Herbert Berghoff.  He was healed of a serious drug habit through his study of Science and Health.  This healing changed his life, bringing renewed commitment to his spiritual journey, As a successful businessman, Adams owned a total of nine flower stores in New York City. In 1985, he sold his businesses and took up the full-time work as a practitioner of Christian Science healing. As a member of the Christian Science Board of Lectureship, Adams speaks internationally on the power of prayer to heal.  He travels from his home in New York City.</p>

                        <p>Infinite Resources, Infinite Intelligence, Infinite Supply by Christine Driessen, C.S.B.</p>
                        <p>Her talk will address how there are spiritual laws underlying the true economy, which enable every individual to succeed, and the divine law of supply and demand insures that there is an equality–that each person has God-given talents and resources which can never be lost nor taken away. Supply always meets demand and demand always meets supply in the divine economy where our true resources are spiritual and therefore inexhaustible.</p>

                        <p>Christine will share examples of her work that demonstrate how relying on infinite Mind and intelligence change our basis from a material perspective to a spiritual one.. Her ideas are based on The Bible and Science and Health with key to The Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy, a world leader of the 19th and early 20th century, and a Concord, NH native and resident.</p>

                        <p>Before entering this healing practice, Christine worked as an inner city school teacher, a professional harpist and dancer, Director of the Indo-Chinese Refugee Legal Assistance Program, and an attorney specializing in criminal, juvenile and domestic litigation.</p>

                        <p>This lecture/workshop is sure to be like a refreshing cup of cold water in a desert of human fears. We cannot wait to share it with you.</p>

                        <p>Concord Gets a Refresher on Christian Science - December 4, 2012 - Published in the Concord Monitor</p>

                        <p>Tuesday evening at the McAulliffe Shepard Discovery Center a near capacity crowd got to hear a lecture on the economy, jobs and employment and how we can all count on the everpresence of Infinite Resources and Infinite Intelligence to manifest themselves in Infinite Supply (the title of the lecture). Participants considered concepts discovered and introduced to everyone over a century ago by Concord-based, Bow-born Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the world-wide movement of Christian Science.</p>

                        <p>The Lecturer, Christine Driessen, is a full-time practitioner, who dedicates herself to the very practical and reliable healing of all manner of challenges through prayer to this Infinite Intelligence. Driessen also teaches Christian Science and lectures all over the world as an active member of the Christian Science Board of Lectureship, based in Boston.</p>

                        <p>The audience was promised an hour and a half but lingered for over two hours, learning with Driessen’s presentation and guidance where they could go in the Bible and the Christian Science textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scripture, by Eddy, to learn the everpresent availability of  infinite, divine Love’s abundant care for each of us. </p>

                        <p>Time flew, and it took another 30 minutes for Driessen to answer questions from participants who hungered to know more, after the lecture concluded.  An appropriate exploration for the Discovery Center, enjoyed and appreciated by those who attended. All were given their “manna” that evening, for sure.</p>

                        <p>If you missed the lecture, or want to see it again or learn more about what underpins its points, we have it available at our Christian Science Reading Room in a video that Christine gave in another location. The Reading Room is located at 34 North Main Street in Concord. The lecture’s references in the Bible and Science and Health are there to explore, along with a bibliography of articles and verified testimonies of healing based on this scientific system of healing through prayer. It’s a place to go for your spiritual growth, regardless of your religion. You won’t experience any interference with your spiritual foundation. But the attendant will be happy to answer your questions if you have any.</p>

                        <p>The other opportunity for those who attended and all who wished they had, is to come to a Wednesday Evening Testimony Meeting, held at 7PM in the Church at the corner of N. State and School Street in town. </p>

                        <p>A warm and supportive welcome awaits all who come. There one will witness how those relying on Christian Science have applied it’s teachings to their problems, and found healing and love and appreciated progress in their exploration of spiritual unfoldment in their lives.</p>

                        <p>Organ concert brought a sense of brotherhood [Acknowledged by Noelle Stokes, Community News Editor, on Friday, January 3, 2014 that this article will be in the Monday, January 6th Concord Monitor on page A7]</p>
                        <p>A huge thank you to all who came out on Dec. 22, when the members of First Church of Christ Scientist in Concord welcomed the community and friends from all over the tri-state area to their annual Christmas organ concert, centered around the massive Hutchings-Votey organ that filled the church with its wonderful sounds for everyone to come and enjoy. The Christmas organ and trumpet concert “Christmas Celebration” drew more than a hundred folks from all over, with attendance from the greater Concord community at large breaking the records.</p>
                        <img src="images/2013duet.jpg" alt="Duet">
                        <p>The centerpiece of the event was the Christmas celebration organ and trumpet concert, programmed and played by Dr. Susan Armstrong. Armstrong was accompanied by Vincent Monaco on trumpet and by Michael Sklader in organ duets. The program took all of us on a walk from the promise and anticipation of the birth of Christ, to the celebration of his birth, and the carol sing retraced that story with passages read from the Bible and Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer and founder of Christian Science.</p>
                        <p>The audience was cheered and lifted by this beautiful program. Many congregants from other churches in the community introduced themselves after the concert, and all shared in the love and brotherhood of the moment. No wonder, considering the stellar reputations of our performing musicians!</p>
                        <p>The organ and trumpet concert was followed by a little audience participation with a lovely carol sing. To our pleasant surprise, very few folks left after the concert during the intermission before the carol sing. During the break, any who had interest in the organ were invited up to the organ console to get a look and a tour conducted by Sklader. The line stretched back into the church, the interest keen and energized by the incredible range of the organ’s voice, so wonderfully expressed by Armstrong in her selections and execution!</p>
                        <p>All who stayed on for the carol sing were given another pleasant surprise, when trumpeter Monaco decided to stay on to add his wonderful accompaniment to the singing of the Christmas carols.</p>
                        <p>The concert was a wonderful experience of community and brotherhood for all who came, and opened a new chapter of love and mutual understanding among all good neighbors in Concord and beyond.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to everyone for coming to this Christmas celebration! Rejoicing and praise to all and to all a wonderful, loving, peaceful and generous new year! -Chris Coombs</p>

                        <p>Recital Program Notes</p>
                        <p>The Organ and Trumpet Concert:</p>
                        <p>Sleepers Wake!</p>
                        <p>The Concert opens with a treatment of the traditional advent tune “Wach­et auf, ruft uns die Stimme”. The words may have been in­spired by a 1523 po­em by Nurem­berg’s Meist­er­sing­er Lu­ther­an po­et Hans Sachs (1494-1576)</p>
                        <p>Wake, awake, for night is flying;</p>
                        <p>The watchmen on the heights are crying:</p>
                        <p>Awake, Jerusalem, at last!</p>
                        <p>Long heralded as the beginning of the Christmas season, it has for a long time been a source of musical inspiration.</p>
                        <p>In Dulci Jubilo</p>
                        <p>This chorale by Diderik Buxtehude sets the fourteenth-century macaronic hymn In dulci jubilo. (Its text is both in Latin and German.) The text of the first verse reads, “In sweet jollity now sing and rejoice: The delight of our heart lies in a manger and shines like the sun at his mother’s breast. He is alpha and omega.” The last two verses of the hymn end with the expression of the desire to have actually been there when all of this happened. Buxtehude places the hymn melody in the soprano, as he frequently does in his chorale treatments, and deploys it with liberal embellishment. When the text speaks of rejoicing, Buxtehude uses some tricks with octave displacement to paint a picture of extroverted celebration. Like the chorale prelude on Puer natus in Bethlehem, this piece is in 3/2 time.</p>
                        <p>Christmas Fantasy In March Form</p>
                        <p>The English-born American organist and composer, Roland Diggle, was educated at the Royal College of Music in London.
                        Diggle moved to the USA in 1904. He was a tireless advocate of organ music and wrote and arranged an enormous number of published pieces (over 500 organ compositions). He served for 40 years as organist and choirmaster at St. John’s Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, California. He was well known in national and international music circles and his works have been published both here and abroad. He presented recitals at both the San Diego and San Francisco World’s Expositions.</p>
                        <p>A Christmas Pastorale</p>
                        <p>Played by two organist seated at the console, this pastoral scene starts out like a piper quietly calling the Shepherd with a pan flute to the background of the strings. Based on “The Sussex Carol”, On Christmas Night All Christians Sing, the chimes beckon, as flute, horn, string and oboe take their turn playing.</p>
                        <p>Trumpet Tune</p>
                        <p>Roger Hannahs wrote this trumpet tune as an organ solo. Dr. Armstrong commissioned this piece for a performance at the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany, NY, where she  recorded it on her compact disc, “Romantic Masterpieces”.  For this concert Armstrong transcribed the work for trumpet and organ. Hannahs also wrote a concerto for organ and orchestra, which he conducted and Armstrong performed with the Albany Symphony. Hannahs won several awards for his compositions and has had much of his opus published.</p>
                        <p>O Come, O Come, Emmanuel</p>
                        <p>Composer Richard Ellsasser (1926 -1972) was an American concert organist, composer, and conductor, who was primarily active during the 1940s, 50’s and 60’s. The young Ellsasser was a musical prodigy who studied piano and organ, first with his father, and later with Winslow Cheney and Albert Riemenschneider.. He made his New York organ debut in 1937. At the age of 19 he became the youngest person in history to have played, from memory, all 250+ organ works of J. S. Bach. </p>
                        <p>Prelude, opus 29</p>
                        <p>Noted French composer, conductor and organist, (Henri-Constant-) Gabriel Pierné, has been called the most complete French musician of the late Romantic/early 20th century era. In his own music Pierné blended a seriousness of purpose (acquired in part through his studies with César Franck) with a lighter, more popular flavor reminiscent of Jules Massenet (with whom Pierné also studied. Pierné displayed great musical promise as a child. At age 11 Pierné earned a medal for his solfège skills. In 1882 he was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome with his cantata Edith.</p>
                        <p>Lullabye   Alexandre Guilmant</p>
                        <p>In 1871 Guilmant was appointed to play the organ regularly at la Trinité church in Paris, and this position he held for 30 years.[1] From then on Guilmant followed a career as a virtuoso; he gave concerts in the United States (the first major French organist to tour that country), and in Canada, as well as in Europe, making especially frequent visits to England. His American achievements included a 1904 series of no fewer than 40 recitals on the largest organ in the world, the St. Louis Exposition Organ, now preserved as the nucleus of Philadelphia‘s Wanamaker Organ.</p>
                        <p>Festive Processional</p>
                        <p>Composer Lasky is Director of Music and Organist at St. Cecilia’s Roman Catholic Church in Leominster, MA. He earned his Bachelor of Music degree in Music History and Literature at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell in 1979, and earned his Master of Music degree in Organ Performance, also at UMASS/Lowell, in 1981. In 2005, he earned his Master of Arts degree in Church Music and Liturgy from the Rensselaer Program of Church Music and Liturgy at St. Joseph’s College, Rensselaer, Indiana.</p>
                        <p>Silent Night</p> 
                        <p>Composer Dudley Buck (1839 –1909) was an American composer, organist, and writer on music. He published several books, most notably the Dictionary of Musical Terms and Influence of the Organ in History, which was published in New York in 1882. This piece reflects his style.</p>
                        <p>Adeste Fideles </p>
                        <p>Thomas Frederick Handel Candlyn (1892–1964) was an English-born organist, composer and choirmaster who spent most of his professional career at two Episcopal Church congregations in New York.He received the Bachelor of Music degree from Durham University in 1911.  During his years in Albany, Candlyn taught at the New York State College for Teachers. He served as chair of the music department beginning in 1924 and received an honorary Doctorate of Pedagogy (Pd.D.) from the College in June 1927. He founded the Albany Oratorio Society and conducted the Mendelssohn Club of Albany during its 1939-1940 and 1940-1941 seasons.  Candlyn composed two hundred works, primarily anthems, cantatas, service settings and organ solos. Three of his anthems (“Christ, whose glory fills the skies,” “Thee We Adore,” and “King of Glory, King of Peace”) remain part of the standard repertoire of Episcopal church choirs in North America. </p>
                        <p>This piece reflects the many moods of Christmas with its improvisatory style and form. It includes “O come, O Come, Emmanuel” , “O Come All Ye Faithful”, “Good Christian Men Rejoice”, “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”. There is an interplay of melody and rhythms as these tunes are creatively woven together. The organ serves to enhance the powers of this musical fantasy.</p>
                        <p>Puer Natus, Opus 29#2 ( A Child is Born)</p>
                        <p>Composer Paul Lindsley Thomas was honored recently during a concert at the Meyerson Symphony Hall, Dallas, Texas. Five of Dr. Thomas’ compositions were performed, following which Dr. Charlotte Kroeker, executive director of CMI, cited Dr. Thomas’ accomplishments and introduced him to the audience. Dr. Thomas received a standing ovation. The previous evening at a dinner in his honor, Dr. Thomas received a Life Achievement Award from the CMI. He is a member of the ASCAP, and his biography is in Who’s Who in America.</p>

                        <p>Trumpet Tune on “Wake, Awake The Night is Flying”</p>
                        <p>The Concert opens with a  treatment of the traditional advent tune “Wach­et auf, ruft uns die Stimme”. The words may have been in­spired by a 1523 po­em by Nurem­berg’s Meist­er­sing­er Lu­ther­an po­et Hans Sachs (1494-1576)</p>
                        <p>Wake, awake, for night is flying;</p>
                        <p>The watchmen on the heights are crying:</p>
                        <p>Awake, Jerusalem, at last!</p>
                        <p>Long heralded as the beginning of the Christmas season, it has for a long time been a source of musical inspiration.</p>
                        <p>I Saw Three Ships Come Sailing In</p>
                        <p>Based on a Traditional English Carol of 15th Century,  this dance like arrangement includes a portion of the melody “O come all ye Faithful”.</p>
                        <p>Fantasy on God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen</p>
                        <p>London medieval melody  often sung in the open air  by strolling bands  and minstrels,  This organ fantasy begins with a thundering statement of the theme in the pedals, answered in turn by the keyboards. The tune intertwines, showcasing the many voices of the organ as it climbs and turns, ending with a powerful statement of the last phrase of the carol.</p>
                        <p>Cantique de Noel</p>
                        <p>This sweet carol, was penned by the same composer who, in his opera Giselle, created what is said to be the most difficult role for a male ballet dancer.  Translated to English as ” O Holy Night”, is an international favorite, and is said to have been the first music broadcast on radio.</p>
                        <p>Noel Polanaise</p>
                        <p>This set of variations on a traditional Polish Christmas carol, provides varieties of moods.</p>
                        <p>In 1871 Alexandre Guilmant was appointed to play the organ regularly at la Trinité church in Paris, and this position he held for 30 years. From then on Guilmant followed a career as a virtuoso; he gave concerts in the United States (the first major French organist to tour that country), and in Canada, as well as in Europe, making especially frequent visits to England. His American achievements included a 1904 series of no fewer than 40 recitals on the largest organ in the world, the St. Louis Exposition Organ, now preserved as the nucleus of Philadelphia’s Wanamaker Organ.</p>
                        <p>O Come, All Ye Faithful</p>
                        <p>A fine example of repeat tunes popular in late 18th century America and England, this organ and trumpet piece provides a joyous journey.</p>
                        <p>After an organ fanfare, the trumpet sounds the tune of this well known carol, after a playful interlude variation on the organ, the trumpet reenters and brings it all to a festive conclusion.</p>
                        <p>A Christmas Pastorale</p>
                        <p>Played by two organist seated at the console, this pastoral scene starts out like a piper quietly calling the Shepherd with a pan flute to the background of the strings. Based on “The Sussex Carol”, On Christmas Night All Christians Sing, the chimes beckon, as flute, horn, string and oboe take their turn playing.</p>
                        <p>Christmas Fantasy –  Organ and Trumpet</p>
                        <p>It reflects the many moods of Christmas with its improvisatory style and form. It includes “O come, O Come, Emmanuel” , “O Come All Ye Faithful”, “Good Christian Men Rejoice”, “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”. There is an interplay of melody and rhythms as these tunes are creatively woven together. The organ serves to enhance the powers of this musical fantasy.</p>
                        <p>Evening  Bells and Cradle Song</p>
                        <p>This piece was written in 1912, the year thatPortlandCity Hallacquired its famous organ. Will C. Macfarlane was hired as organist and wrote this piece for this large marvel of an orchestral instrument. It evokes a magical feeling so fitting to the season. Macfarlane gave a copy of his 1912 score to Gilbert Macfarlane, who in turn, presented it to Susan Armstrong for her concert repertoire.</p>
                        <p>Perfectly suited for this organ, it gives us some orchestral sounds not often heard.</p>
                        <p>Christmas Fantasy – Organ Duet.</p>
                        <p>Also including familiar Christmas Carols, this Duet begins with the sound of the Chimes summoning us to gather for the Carol Sing that follows the Concert..  With Four hands and Four feet,  it showcases the many rich and varied voices of this magnificent instrument. It goes from the absolute quietest stops to  “hold on to your pews, it’s going to be a bumpy night”, ending with full organ. Merry Christmas!</p>

                        <p>June 17th, 2016 Longyear Spring New England Tour</p>
                        <p>This Longyear Museum tour of Mrs. Eddy’s homes and our church in the past has been an annual event.  However, this year there will also be a fall tour as well.</p>
                        <p>Concord Market Days Festival, June 23rd, 24th, and 25th, 2016 </p> 
                        <p>For many years the Reading Room has participated in Market Days with a small tent outside the Reading Room where periodicals are displayed, some free and some for sale.  Conversations are lively and afford opportunities to connect with many in the Concord community.</p>

                        <p>Each year recently a group has visited from Daystar Foundation and Library in Oklahoma City, OK.  http://daystarfoundation.org/  This year they will be coming on Wednesday, August 3rd.  They attend our Wednesday evening meeting and then stay for a tour.  Several have been especially interested in our organ and are given an extended musical introduction prior to the church tour.  We so love having them visit.</p>
                        <p>August 19th, 2016 Principia Life Long Learning Tour</p>
